# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-Summary

The Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis focused on building multiple queries using in house information from the employee database to help show senior department managers which employees retiring were born between the dates of 1952-01-01 to 1955-12-31 and also their most recent job title.  Workers employeed at Pewlett-Hackard for a significant amount of time often hold multiple titles throughout their careers which was factored into my analysis by finding the current employees within our designated age brackets most recent job title.  Breaking down each query into smaller tables help communicate to relevant Pewlett-Hackard stakeholders which departments are losing their most senior workers.  Another important part of the overall analysis was creating a query to find out which employees born between the dates of 1965-01-01 and 1965-12-31 were eligible for mentorship.

3. The number of employees born in the year 1965 who are qualified for mentorship eligibility number at 1,549. L&D programs should be focused on specific departments that will lose the most amount of senior talent and experience such as Pewlett-Hackards senior engineering department which may see reductions or delays in meeting product supply. 

4. The most affected departments will be the engineers and senior enginneers with a total of 35,174 workers retiring which represents a little under 50% of currently retiring Pewlett-Hackard workforce.  Investments should focus most of the upcoming workforce training on developing engineers to Pewlett-Hackards standards to not jeapordize TQM reductions.
